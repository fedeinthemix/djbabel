Serato DJ Pro
=============

Importing Playlists
-------------------

Serato DJ Pro ignores the data generated by djbabel if some tags are missing (for example, because they can't ge generated, such as the overview picture). The following procedure ensures that the tags generated by djbabel are used correctly.

After using djbabel to create a new crate, you have to:

1. Copy the file in the 'subcrates' directory where all crates reside. On Windows, by default, ``C:\Users\user_name\Music\_Serato_\Subcrates``. (Substitute your user name for ``user_name``.)
2. Open 'Serato DJ Pro' in preparation mode (with the audio hardware OFF/disconnected).
3. Disable 'Set Beaggrid/BPM' (in the gear icon next to the 'Analyze Files' button).
4. Analyse the files in the new crate by dragging the crate on the 'Analyse Files' button.

Limitations
-----------

Since Serato Flips are Serato DJ Pro specific, they are ignored.


Traktor Pro 4
=============

Exporting a Playlist
--------------------

1. Create a playlist with the files you want to transfer.
2. Right-click the netlist and select 'Export Playlist'.
3. Disable 'Copy Tracks To Destination', select a name, destination and press OK. This will create an NML file with the name you selected. Unless you use the same name for the file as for the playlist, you'll have to use the ``--playlist-name`` option in djbabel.
4. Use djbabel to convert to the desired target format.


Importing Playlists
-------------------

1. In the Traktor collection browser right-click on 'Playlists' and select 'Import Playlist'.
2. Select the NML playlist file that you want to import.

Limitations
-----------

Since Remix-Sets are Traktor specific, they are ignored.


Rekordbox 7
===========

Exporting a Playlist
--------------------

It's not possible to export only a single playlist in rekordbox XML format, you can only export the entire collection, which however does contain all playlists.
To export the collection:

1. Select File->Export Collection in xml format.
2. Select the destination file name and folder, and press OK.

When running djbabel, specify the name of the playlist that you want to convert using the ``--playlist-name`` option, and select the collection as input playlist.


Importing Playlists
-------------------

1. In rekordbox go to File -> Preferences.
2. In the 'Advanced' category, select the 'Database' tab.
3. Under 'Imported Library' select the playlist.xml file generated by djbabel.
4. Close the preference windows.
5. In the 'media browser' , select 'Display rekordbox xml'.
6. In the 'tree view', under 'Playlists', you'll find the new playlist.  (You may have to press the 'reload' button.)

If 'Display rekordbox xml' is not shown, check the rekordbox manuall for how to display it.

Limitations
-----------

Currently djbabel only reads and writes hot-cues/loops. Momeory cues and loops are ignored. In the future this may change.
