SERATO DJ Pro
=============

Importing a generated crate
---------------------------

Serato DJ Pro ignores the data generated by 'djbabel' if some tags are missing (for example, because they can't ge generated, such as the overview picture). The following procedure ensures that they are present.

After using 'djbabel' to create a new crate, you have to:

1. Copy the file in the 'subcrates' directory where all crates reside.

2. Open 'Serato DJ Pro' in preparation mode (with the audio hardware OFF/disconnected).

3. Disable 'Set Beaggrid/BPM' (in the gear icon next to the 'Analyze Files' button).

4. Analyse the files in the new crate by dragging the crate on on 'Analyse Files' button.
